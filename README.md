This is my first time using a framework for developing a website. I decided to use Bootstrap, because of its popularity. Also for structural and development support I am using react with typescript.

## Bootstrap
React-Bootstrap allows for quick snippets of code to be added into a project. This framework makes developing a lot faster, because instead of writing those components yourself, you can just add them to your project and customize them accordingly.

## React
For this project I decided to use React, because I am comfortable with it and it is a very powerful tool for writing javascript.

## Typescript
Typescript is a syntactic sugar, that allows for a protected, well structured, maintainable code base.
